# SimpleTaskQueue
A simple task queue used for coordinating distributed, parallel work.

Note to all people wanting to use this project -- it's close. v0.1.0 is scheduled for 2018-09-15 and I'm fairly certain I'm going to hit that self-imposed deadline.

You will know it is ready for prime time when there is more documentation than this simple README.md
